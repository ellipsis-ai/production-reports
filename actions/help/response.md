Hello, {successResult.slackUserName} and welcome to the Production Reports skill.

The skill will prompt people on a given day of the week to upload their latest production report. Later the same day, it will post this report in another channel.

You can schedule it to run at the same time for all members of a channel by typing: `...setup production report`.

If you ever want to provide a production report manually, you can type: `...collect production report`
